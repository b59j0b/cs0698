EEE350 – Sem1 ‐ Assignment 
Introduction
‐             This assignment depends   on   Sem   1   material.
‐ The assessment will   be   based on   FEMM4.2 software
‐          The assignment   might   contain   elements   that   have   not   been   covered   in   the   lectures.         ‐   You   should   provide   all   workings   and   explanations   in   your   solutions.   Also, justify   your
design selection, if any. These will   variously count towards achieving full marks in this   assessment.
Submission Details You can complete your answers as a word‐processed document or as handwritten sheets   (The word   document   is   preferred).   Please   save   or scan these   respectively   into   a   pdf file.   Copy   any   graphs   into   a   word   document,   then   save   them   into   a   pdf   file.   Also,   copy   any   figures or graphs from   FEMM4.2   into a word document. As this submission   is   considered   a   formal   report,   The   first‐page   template   is   added   to   the   same   folder.   Convert   the   first   page   into   pdf format and   merge your documents   into one   pdf file.This assignment has two questions. Question 1 is an electrostatic problem,    while   question   2   is   an   electromagnetic   problem.   It   is   recommended   to   add   a   summary   page   for your   answer.

This assignment   is   a MUST‐PASS ELEMENT. The   minimum grade to   pass   is   40   %.
Question 1 [60 marks] A   single   core lead   sheathed cable   with   voltage (60+m)    kV shown    in   figure 1 has a   conductor radius of R = (15 + m/2) mm and two   layers of insulating material   with   relative   permittivity r1 and r2,   respectively. The   radii   of   layers   1   and   2   are r1 = (30 + m/2) mm and r2 = (35 + m/2) mm respectively.   Choose   the   material   of   layer   1   as   Polypropylene   (you   can   modify   the   property   to   match   your   design).   Choose   the   material   of   layer   2   as   PVC   (you   can   change   the   property to   match your   design). The   conductor   is   copper   (You   can add a new property as a copper conductor and select a valid value for the permittivity   of the copper   conductor).

Hints:   Design   requirements:
•          Choose   a   planar   solution
•            Use   length   units   in   millimetres
•            Depth   1000   mm.
•          Add a   boundary   layer filled   with   air.
•          Choose your   mesh   not   higher than 0.5   mm to   improve the   solution's   accuracy.

Question 2 [40 marks] Figure   2   shows   a   solenoid system. The   coil   has   a   resistance   of   2             and   the   number   of   turns   N   =    (500+2*m)   turns.   the    air‐gap    length    has   the    boundaries    (0    < x < 20 mm).
